The entire package (online purchase) has the following items:

01.Arduino UNO R3 Board with usb cable to PC

02.Sensor Shield v5.0 Board

03.Motor Shield (L298N)

04.Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

05.Mini Servo Motor (SG90)

06.DC Motor x4

07.Wheel x4

08.Chassis plate

09.Holder for HC-SR04

10.Wires Red x 4 Black x 4

11.Battery 4 slot holder

12.4 channels infrared avoidance module

Additional f-f jumper wires would need to be purchased.

You need to download from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software to get the arduino developing environment.  You would need to do some soldering to connect the DC Motor to L298N.  Connect L298N to Arduino UNO R3 Board. (Reference:Arduino Robot Car Control by Dejan Nedelkovski, www.HowToMechatronics.com)
